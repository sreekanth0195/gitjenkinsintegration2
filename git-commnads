GIT PHAESES :  1) workspace area
               2) staging / index area
               3) local repo

SENARIO - touch file1 (give content as "hello world")
          git status --> this file is in workspace area (shows as UNTRACKED FILE in RED colour)
          git add    --> add this file from workspace to staging area 
          git status --> (shows as CHANGES TO BE COMMITTED in green colour) 
          git commit -m "label" file1 --> this file will go from staging area to local repo
          git log    --> gives commit id for the file at local repo
          git show cid  --> gives file info
AGAIN YOU MADE CHANGES IN file1 CREATED, IT WILL GO TO WORKSPACE (AS UNTRACKED FILE in RED COLOUR)
***since the file1 is alredy created and just edit is done it can directly commit to local repo no need of staging area(i.e git add)
 
git add .        --> this command will add ALL files in .git into staging area
git reset HEAD 'filename'  --> revert back your added file in staging area to workspace
git reset --soft cid   ---> revert backs commit from local repo to staging area
git reset --mixed cid  ---> reverts your commit directly from local repo to workspace(at that time if there are any filea in staging area they
                                                                                      will also come back to workspace )
